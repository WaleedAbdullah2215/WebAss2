Which are as follows:
1) Index.html - This file is the main html file which is started when using the website. THis page displays important weather related information
                for a specific city that is seached by the user. Moreover 3 charts are also shown on this page to sumamrize the weather information.
                The page allows the user to enter the name of a city, and after submitting the query, the relevant weather data is fetched from the server using API and displayed visually in an easy-to-understand format.
